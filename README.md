# my_database_for_church_members_commitment
<br>I created database for church members personal information and their amount of commitment for church building. This is a real-world data<br>
<br>I created tables for commitment and church members<br>
I group members according to their ministry, and age classifications.
I used filtering to retrieve the highest and lowest amount of commitment contributed by each church members 
Joining two tables to identify each amount of commitment
Use aggregation to calculate the average and sum of commitment, used count to count members for a group ministries and the total members
Use window functions to know the rank of members from hihest to lowest based on the amount of commitment contibuted by each members
