# my_database_for_church_members_commitment
<br>I created database for church members personal information and their amount of commitment for church building. This is a real-world data<br>
<br>I created tables for commitment and church members<br>
<br>I group members according to their ministry, and age classifications.<br>
<br>I used filtering to retrieve the highest and lowest amount of commitment contributed by each church members <br>
<br>Joining two tables to identify each amount of commitment<br>
<br>Use aggregation to calculate the average and sum of commitment, used count to count members for a group ministries and the total members<br>
<br>Use window functions to know the rank of members from hihest to lowest based on the amount of commitment contibuted by each members<br>
